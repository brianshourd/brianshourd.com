===============

This is the repo containing all code and content (except images) for my
personal website: [brianshourd.com](http://brianshourd.com).

Some of the technologies used include:

* [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
* [Toast](http://daneden.me/toast/)
* [Mathjax](http://www.mathjax.org/)

This code is placed up as an example of what can be done with Hakyll,
specifically. Feel free to re-use any of my code that you find helpful.

In particular, there is a bit of code that changes the color scheme of a
webpage based on a hash of its contents that I think is pretty fun.

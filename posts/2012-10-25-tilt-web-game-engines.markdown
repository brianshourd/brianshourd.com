I just heard about [GitHub's Game Off](https://github.com/blog/1303-github-game-off) today, and I think that I might participate. It's a game jam where coders have until the end of November to create a game that has something to do with Git/GitHub keywords (fork/branch/clone/push/pull). However, one of the requirements is that the game run in the browser.

That's new territory for me.

Which is, of course, very exciting. I briefly looked into some of the options listed: [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) and Flash are both proprietary, so I'd prefer not them. [Torque 3D](http://www.garagegames.com/products/torque-3d) looks really cool, but creating art for 3D games is even more work than creating it for 2D games - I think I'd prefer the latter, given a choice. That basically leaves [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) or some sort of engine built on HTML5/Javascript (a quick search yields [LimeJS](http://www.limejs.com/), [CraftyJS](http://craftyjs.com/), and [ImpactJS](http://impactjs.com/)).

I'm not sure what exactly I'll end up doing, but I learned a lot about the current state of web-based game engines today.

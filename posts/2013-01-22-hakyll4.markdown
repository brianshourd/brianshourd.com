Today I finished upgrading my blog from Hakyll 3 to [Hakyll
4](https://github.com/jaspervdj/jaspervdj). I'm quite excited.

The move wasn't nearly as hard as I thought that it would be. [Jasper
Van der Jeugt](http://jaspervdj.be/) (the creator of Hakyll) has a great
[guide to
upgrading](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/hakyll-3-to-hakyll4-migration-guide.html)
which answered pretty much all my questions. The only real work was to
get working two things that I had customized over a (more or less)
default site.

1. On-demand [Mathjax](http://mathjax.org) loading based on metadata and
2. Different colors for every page based on a hash of the page's
   contents.

Both of these turned out to be much easier in Hakyll 4 than they were in
Hakyll 3, thanks to the new `Monad` structure of `Compiler`s (vs the old
`Arrow` structure). It might also have something to do with the fact
that I only figure out how to do the color thing [a few days
ago](2013-01-07-different-color-every-page-hakyll.html), so the general
idea was much more well-defined and fresh in my head than it was before.

In any case, check out the [code for the site on
Github](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/tutorials/hakyll-3-to-hakyll4-migration-guide.html)
if you are interested in how I accomplished those things. I don't think
that either is worth a full blog post this time, but I might change my
mind when next I run out of things to write about.

Thanks to Jasper for this great update, and for a fantastic platform to
begin with! I've got to convert the other website that I'm maintaining
to Hakyll next.

My daughter Ada currently is in love with these wierd little toddler
snacks. They're tiny lumps of freeze-dried yogurt, which got me
wondering what exactly freeze-drying is. It's actually a [pretty clever
process](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeze-drying).

The goal, of course, is to take all (or most of) the moisture out of a
biological product, generally with the intention of preserving it.
Normally, one might use a dehydrator - a combination of heat and dry air
in a contained environment to remove all of the water from fruits and/or
meat. This has the problem that the food inside has to be heated to some
extent in order to give the water enough energy to make the transition
from a liquid to a gas.

However, we know that the state of matter (liquid, solid, gas) is
affected not just by temperature, but also by pressure. These phases are
represented by a phase diagram that looks something like:

Diagram](/images/phasediagram.jpg)

At a specific pressure and temperature, water is in the phase plotted on
this chart. Notice that at low temperatures and low pressures, water can
transition directly from a solid to a gas, without being a liquid in
between. This is called *sublimation*, and you may be familiar with it
if you've ever looked at Dry Ice. Dry Ice is just solid carbon dioxide,
and carbon dioxide's phase diagram is such that normal atmospheric
pressure is below the *triple point*, so that it sublimates when it
heats up and we don't get to see liquid carbon dioxide - the ice just
smokes.

If we make an object cold enough so that all the water inside freezes,
then reduce the pressure below the triple point, we can heat the object
back up enough for the frozen water inside to sublimate and escape. In
fact, this whole thing can happen at cold temperatures (relative to room
temperature), so the object itself is still frozen. Hence the name -
*freeze drying*. And that's how we get [astronaut ice
cream](http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/9e07/).

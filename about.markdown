#About Me

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame studying
mathematics. Specifically, I'm studying [Algebraic
Groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_group) and [Lie
Algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra) under Dr. Samuel Evens.

When I'm done next year, I plan on looking for a job in the software
engineering industry. I love solving problems and learning new things,
and I think that a position in a new startup is an environment where I
could thrive.

Lately, I've been enjoying Haskell, and I'm pursuing that
direction quite heavily. Check out some of my [code on
Github](http://github.com/brianshourd) to see what I've been up to.

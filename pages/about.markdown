#About Me

I'm currently a Ph.D. student at the University of Notre Dame studying
mathematics. Specifically, I'm studying [Algebraic
Groups](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_group) and [Lie
Algebras](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra) under Dr. Samuel Evens.

When I'm done in May, I plan on looking for a job in the software
engineering industry. I love solving problems and learning new things,
and I think that a position developing software is an environment where
I could thrive.

I've coded in C++, Python, Java, Haskell, and JavaScript, though I'm
most comfortable in JavaScript, Haskell, and Python. I consider myself a
generalist, and more than anything I love learning new things - whether
that be a new technology, algorithm, language, API, platform, or even an
entire subject area. Check out some of my [code on
Github](http://github.com/brianshourd) to see what I've been up to.

## Personal

I've been married to Skyler for over 3 years, and our daughter Ada just
turned 2. I love making: woodworking, programming, and general DIY. This
year, I'm going to learn to weld.

Besides that, I enjoy a good batch of geekery - I run a monthly
Sci-Fi/Fantasy book club and a monthly D&D campaign with some friends.

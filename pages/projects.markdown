# Projects

If you just want to see all of the code, pretty much everything is
[hosted on Github](https://github.com/brianshourd). However, there are a
few projects that I would like to showcase:

* [Particle Swarm Optimization Visualization](/pso/) - JavaScript -
  Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a
[Metaheuristic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) algorithm
(similar to a genetic algorithm) which uses a model of a swarm of
particles to find the minimum value of a given function. This is a
webapp designed to aid in the visualization of such swarms as they work.
* [Tic-Tac-Toe Bots](/tttbots/) - Haskell - A fun project to play with
  genetic algorithms and bot building in functional languages.
